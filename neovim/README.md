# Neovim Configuration

**⚠️ This directory will be removed after consolidation.**

Configuration has been synced to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nvim\` and packages added to `packages\a3w\packages.json`.

## Added to packages.json:
- `nodejs` - Required for LSP servers
- `mingw` - C compiler for native extensions

## Sync completed:
- All config files synced to active nvim directory
- README updated with proper workflow instructions
- Prerequisites integrated into package management

**Next step:** This directory can be safely removed.
